<h1>B09 Lab week 10</h1>

<p>This is an exercise on the nuances in spawning processes and setting up
pipes.

<p>Overview: Two programs foo.c and bar.c are provided. Your job is to write
your own program, bridge.c, that spawns them and sets them up for two-way
communication by pipes.  A makefile is provided for compiling all of them.

<p>In more detail:

<p>bridge should spawn both foo and bar as children, then wait for both to
terminate.

<p>foo expects two command line arguments for: file descriptor to read from, file
descriptor to write to.  See the sample foo.c for details.

<p>bar expects two command line arguments for: file descriptor to read from, file
descriptor to write to.  See the sample bar.c for details.

<p>So bridge should create two pipes: one for the foo-&gt;bar direction (foo writes,
bar reads), the other for the foo&lt;-bar direction (foo reads, bar writes).
And bridge should exec foo and bar with arguments accordingly.
(<code>snprintf()</code> is very helpful for converting numbers to strings.
You may assume that each number is only 10 digits.)

<p>bridge should not redirect stdout for foo and bar.  They need stdout for the
reports shown below.

<p>For simplicity, please hardcode the pathnames <code>./foo</code> and
<code>./bar</code> for the executables.

<p>If bridge.c is correct, foo and bar will report these:

<pre>
foo sends msg 1
bar reads, next line is what I get
msg 1
bar sends reply 1
foo reads, next line is what I get
reply 1
foo closes write end and waits for bar to do the same
bar closes write end and waits for foo to do the same
bar is satisfied
foo is satisfied
</pre>

<p>The last two “satisfied” lines may be in the other order; this is up to the
kernel.

<p>A few common mistakes to watch out for:

<ul>
  <li>Goofing the arguments to <code>exec()</code>.  There is diagnostic code in
    foo.c and bar.c to help you cross check, currently disabled, but you can
    enable and recompile.

  <li>Forgetting to close some file descriptors. If you don't get the “satified”
    messages, this is the #1 suspect.
</ul>

<p>When marking, I will use a different pair of foo.c and bar.c, which exchange
some other messages and print some other reports.  There is nothing to worry
about if you do piping and spawning correctly.

<p>What to hand in: bridge.c
